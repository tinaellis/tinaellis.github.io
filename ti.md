## Threat Intelligence

I became fascinated with Threat Intelligence after listening to <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/65/" target="_blank">Darknet Diaries episode 65, PSYOP</a>, where Jack Rhysider interviews Jon Nichols, a PSYOP specialist who (after leaving the military) began a career in cyber threat intelligence. Working in a Cyber Security Operation Center (CSOC) has helped me understand the "what" and "how" of attacks, and studying threat intelligence has helped me understand the "who" and "why".
