## Threat Intelligence

In the Cyber Security Operations Center, I learned how to spot attacks in real time—how to contain the damage, trace the vectors, and understand what happened and how. But it wasn’t until I stepped into the world of threat intelligence that I began to see the full picture. I started asking different questions—not just what or how, but who did this… and why? Behind every alert is intent. Behind every line of code, a choice. Threat intelligence pulled me deeper, past the noise, into the narratives behind the threats. This page is where I unpack those narratives—of adversaries, motivations, patterns, and purpose. Because intelligence isn’t just about knowing more; it’s about protecting better. And understanding the why makes all the difference.
