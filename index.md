## Time to Git-Init
I am a Cybersecurity student currently studying the 8 CISSP domains. I will be updating this website with lessons learned in those domains as well as programming, network security, forensics, cyberterrorism, and information security whenever I can.

### Employers and Internships
Because of the nature of my academic projects, I am unable to make many of my GitHub repositories public. However, I am able to share these repositories privately upon your request.
