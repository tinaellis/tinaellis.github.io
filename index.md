## Time to Git-Init
I am a Cybersecurity student currently studying the 8 CISSP domains. I will be updating this website with lessons learned in those domains as well as programming, network security, forensics, cyberterrorism, and information security whenever I can.

I am an ambitious incident response intern with a background in project management, wrapping up my Bachelor of Applied Science in Cyber Security degree in June 2023. I have experience analyzing and triaging security alerts, incident response, and threat hunting. Skilled in utilizing various security tools such as SIEM, IDS/IPS, and endpoint protection. I have a passion for threat intelligence and in my free time, I enjoy learning about APTs and staying updated with the latest threat intelligence reports. I am also an active member of my college's cyber security club, where I have participated in Capture the Flag competitions and helped organize events. Furthermore, I am a part of three different internship programs: Cyber Security Analyst Intern in the CSOC team at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. An NCL / CrowdStrike joint mentorship program. And CySER, a Department of Defense internship program.

My goal for this blog is to document my journey as I find time. It will also serve as a guide for those one off things I want to keep on hand and quickly reference. Connect with me if you want to know more about my experience, and skills or are interested in discussing cyber security.

### Employers
Because of the nature of my academic and internship projects, I am unable to make many of my GitHub repositories public. However, I am able to share these repositories privately upon your request.
