## Time to Git-Init
I am an ambitious incident response intern with a background in project management, wrapping up my Bachelor of Applied Science in Cyber Security degree in June 2023. I have experience analyzing and triaging security alerts, incident response, and threat hunting. Skilled in utilizing various security tools such as SIEM, IDS/IPS, and endpoint protection. I have a passion for threat intelligence and in my free time, I enjoy learning about APTs and staying updated with the latest threat intelligence reports. I am also an active member of my college's cyber security club, where I have participated in Capture the Flag competitions and helped organize events. Furthermore, I am a part of three different internship programs: Cyber Security Analyst Intern in the CSOC team at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. An NCL / CrowdStrike joint mentorship program. And CySER, a Department of Defense internship program.

My goal for this blog is to document my journey as I find time. It will also serve as a guide for those one off things I want to keep on hand and quickly reference. Connect with me if you want to know more about my experience, and skills or are interested in discussing cyber security.

### Projects
Threat intelligence is an area of cyber security that I find fascinating and I am thrilled that I was tasked with creating a threat profile for Pacific Northwest National Laboratory as my research project. This project gave me the opportunity to learn more about threat groups and become familiar with the threat intelligence tools, knowledge bases, press releases, and alerts cyber security analysts leverage to enhance cyber defenses.

### Employers
Because of the nature of my academic and internship projects, I am unable to make many of my GitHub repositories public. However, I am able to share these repositories privately upon your request.
