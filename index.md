## Time to Git-Init
I am a Cybersecurity student currently learning about about networks and digital forensics. I will be updating this page with lessons learned in network security, forensics, cyberterrorism, and information security whenever I can.

Swing by my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/tinaellis) to see what I am currently working on.

### Employers and Internships
Because of the nature of my academic projects, I am unable to make many of my GitHub repositories public. However, I am able to share these repositories privately upon your request.

### Suggestions or Contact
This blog is a work in progress and may include errors as I stumble through the new concepts I am learning. If you find an error or have a suggestion for improvement, please reach out to me.

You can find me on Twitter at [@Cybersec_Tina](https://twitter.com/cybersec_tina) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/creativelytinaellis/).
