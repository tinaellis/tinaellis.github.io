<h3>Integrating a Google Alerts RSS Feed with a Static Website</h3>
As it turns out, adding an RSS feed onto a static website hosted on GitHub Pages, isn't easy. Learn about the challenges I faced, my troubleshooting process, and how I leveraged AWS services to overcome these challenges.

<h3>Threat Profile</h3>
Threat intelligence is an area of cyber security that I find fascinating and I am thrilled that I was tasked with creating a threat profile for Pacific Northwest National Laboratory as my summer 2022 internship research project. This project gave me the opportunity to learn more about threat groups and become familiar with the threat intelligence tools, knowledge bases, press releases, and alerts cyber security analysts leverage to enhance cyber defenses.

<h3>Wireless Penetration Testing Presentation</h3>
<p>Wireless penetration tests typically assess three main aspects of a wireless network: its range, the security of the data it transmits, and the possibility of unauthorized wireless access by an attacker. The pen testers conducting these tests, must possess a deep understanding of wireless network operations. This knowledge allows them to identify any weaknesses in the network's setup, and to choose the appropriate hardware and software tools to effectively carry out the testing.</p>

<p>In the following presentation, I discuss the evolution of WLAN security and demonstrate how to capture a WPA2 four-way handshake using the Aircrack suite of tools. I also demonstrate how a deauthentication attack can be used to speed up the process.</p>

<h3>Physical Penetration Testing Presentation</h3>
<p>All bets are off once an adversary has gained physical access. when an attacker has gained physical access to a system or network, all the security measures that were previously in place become virtually useless. The attacker can bypass firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other security mechanisms with ease, and gain direct access to sensitive data, information, or resources. This is why physical penetration testing is an essential aspect of cybersecurity, yet it is often overlooked.</p>
<p>When I noticed that none of my college courses offered any teachings on the subject of physical penetration testing, I decided to take the initiative and present on this topic for my autonomous project. It is crucial for cybersecurity professionals to be aware of the risks associated with physical access and to implement proper measures to mitigate such risks.</p>
