<h3>Integrating a Google Alerts RSS Feed with a Static Website</h3>
As it turns out, adding an RSS feed onto a static website hosted on GitHub Pages, isn't easy. Learn about the challenges I faced, my troubleshooting process, and how I leveraged AWS services to overcome these challenges.

<h3>Threat Profile</h3>
Threat intelligence is an area of cyber security that I find fascinating and I am thrilled that I was tasked with creating a threat profile for Pacific Northwest National Laboratory as my summer 2022 internship research project. This project gave me the opportunity to learn more about threat groups and become familiar with the threat intelligence tools, knowledge bases, press releases, and alerts cyber security analysts leverage to enhance cyber defenses.

<h3>Physical Penetration Presentation</h3>
<p>All bets are off once an adversary has gained physical access. when an attacker has gained physical access to a system or network, all the security measures that were previously in place become virtually useless. The attacker can bypass firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other security mechanisms with ease, and gain direct access to sensitive data, information, or resources. This is why physical penetration testing is an essential aspect of cybersecurity, yet it is often overlooked.</p>
<p>When I noticed that none of my college courses offered any teachings on the subject of physical penetration testing, I decided to take the initiative and present on this topic for my autonomous project. It is crucial for cybersecurity professionals to be aware of the risks associated with physical access and to implement proper measures to mitigate such risks.</p>

<h3>World Map</h3>
<p>Because I am a visual person, I decided to create a map to help me better understand how geopolitical factors might impact threat actor motivations and campaigns. While searching for a suitable map, I discovered that Displate sells magnetic metal canvases and decided to order one of the world, <em>not realizing it came in four separate sections</em>. As I learn about different threat groups, I have added personalized magnets to the map. I also created dye-cut magnets with animal names used in CrowdStrike's naming conventions, which I keep on the map as a reminder for myself, and because they look cool.</p>
<p>I mention this project here because it's important to me. This map hangs on my wall adjacent to my desk and serves as a physical reminder that these threats exist in the real world and they seek to disrupt, influence, and harm the lives of innocent people.</p>
