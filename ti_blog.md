## Blog
This blog is my space to think out loud about threat intelligence—to explore ideas, share observations, and connect dots that don’t always fit neatly into a report. Threat intel is a field built on nuance, patterns, and questions that don’t always have clear answers. Here, I dive into the things that catch my attention: actor behavior, tradecraft trends, strange infrastructure choices, or just thoughts sparked during an investigation. It’s less about being polished and more about being curious—because sometimes, writing it out is how the insight reveals itself.
