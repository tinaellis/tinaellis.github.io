## Cyber Threat Intelligence

I became fascinated with Threat Intelligence after listening to <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/65/" target="_blank">Darknet Diaries episode 65, PSYOP</a>, where Jack Rhysider interviews Jon Nichols, a PSYOP specialist who (after leaving the military) began a career in cyber threat intelligence. Working in a Cyber Security Operation Center (CSOC) has helped me understand the "what" and "how" of attacks, and studying threat intelligence has helped me understand the "who" and "why".

### Terms Defined

<p>While sometimes confused with each other, threat intelligence and threat hunting are two different disciplines in the field of cybersecurity, and they require different sets of skills and approaches. While they are related and can complement each other, they are distinct in their goals and methods.</p>
<p><strong>Threat intelligence</strong> is the practice of gathering and analyzing information about potential cyber threats and vulnerabilities. It involves collecting data from a variety of source to identify potential threats to an organization's systems and data. The goal of threat intelligence is to provide insights into the nature and scope of potential threats, and to inform security measures and incident response.</p>
<p><strong>Threat hunting</strong>, on the other hand, is a proactive approach to cybersecurity that involves actively searching for signs of potential threats or malicious activity within an organization's network or systems. It involves using advanced analytics and other tools to identify anomalous behavior, suspicious patterns, and other indicators that may suggest a security breach or attack. The goal of threat hunting is to detect and respond to threats before they can cause significant harm.</p>
<p><strong>Threat Modeling</strong>, is a process used in cybersecurity to identify and evaluate potential security threats to a system or application. It is a proactive approach that helps organizations to understand their security risks and to implement measures to address those risks before they can be exploited.</p>
