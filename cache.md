## The Cache

The Cache is my personal repository of quick-reference notes, commands, and study materials—stored for speed, simplicity, and survival. I believe documenting your technical journey is essential, even if the information evolves or becomes outdated. Writing things down reinforces learning, tracks progress, and creates a trail worth following—for yourself or others.
